Implementation of two intelligent system models (Artificial Neural Network and Linear Regression).

The case study at hand is on a company that offers transport services. The two most well-known companies that offer ride and ride-sharing services are Uber and Lyft. Since the majority of businesses strive for profitability, different factors influence the pricing that is set. According to the case study, the price set can change depending on variables like the time of day, the location, the climate, and other similar ones. This study will develop successive generations of models to examine and forecast pricing while taking into account of the influencing factors.
